What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I'm quite happy that I've learned a bit more about the Terminal and writing Bash scripts. I'm
a novice at CLI (skipped COS 126 so am starting from scratch) so this assignment was a bit difficult, 
but it was nevertheless fun to dabble in a new language with such practical usecases. In addition,
learning Github formally through the CLI was incredibly helpful.
